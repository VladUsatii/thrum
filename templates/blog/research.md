# research

is super important in csec, especially when handling $$$ and global state.

to get a job at thrum and build better crypto csec tooling:

1. do some bounties
2. send us a new type of bug or edge case that is either (a) rare or (b) novel
3. we'll give you an AI-proofed task to see skill

## salaries

$100,000 / year for swen

$110,000 / year for hardware eng

$150,000 / year for phd/sr-lvl program analysis (we'll need a resume for that)

## investment

always seeking investment from crypto firms to "build general intelligence for csec."

* in what way can this be done better if not on a decentralized, general-purpose cryptocurrency system like ethereum?
* how generalizable is crypto csec to the entire world of csec?
* what are the financial implications of better tooling?

### our roadmap

```release thrum v1``` first.
