# Thrum Credit Terms

Last Updated: [2025-12-07]

1. What Thrum Credits are

1.1. Thrum Credits are digital account credits that may be used solely to purchase a Thrum service. This includes scans, reports, and cloud compute.
1.2. Thrum Credits have no cash value. Thrum Credits are not legal tender, are not a bank account, and are not redeemable or exchangeable for money, fiat currency, or cryptocurrency.
1.3. Thrum Credits have closed-loop use. Thrum Credits are usable only for transactions with Thrum (a defined merchant) and are not an open-loop currency.

2. Eligibility and permitted use

2.1. You must have capacity to enter into these terms and comply with applicable law.
2.2. You may not use Thrum Credits where prohibited by law.

3. Sanctions and restricted jurisdictions

3.1. You represent that you are not located in, ordinarily resident in, or organized under the laws of any jurisdiction subject to comprehensive U.S. sanctions, and you are not a blocked person.
3.2. We may block access, suspend accounts, or refuse transactions where we reasonably believe sanctions risk exists. We may also require additional information to complete compliance checks so as to comply with emerging US law.
3.3. We may use geolocation and other technical controls to enforce these restrictions.

4. Purchasing Thrum Credits with cryptocurrency

4.1. When you deposit ETH (or ETH Sepolia during the testing stage) to a Thrum-provided deposit address, we will credit your account after the deposit reaches the required number of blockchain confirmations (12 for ETH, 1 for ETH Sepolia) displayed at purchase time.
4.2. Irreversibility. Blockchain transactions are irreversible. You are responsible for sending funds on the correct network and in the correct asset type.
4.3. Wrong network and/or wrong token. Deposits sent on an unsupported network or in an unsupported token may not be credited and may be unrecoverable. We heavily advise against blind payments: make sure you note the time your transaction occurred, on what network it occurred, and any relevant facts to help you confirm it was deposited into our designated wallet addresses.

5. Pricing and conversion

5.1. The credit conversion rate (e.g., wei-per-credit) is disclosed at the time of purchase and may change prospectively.
5.2. Your purchase summary (network, address, amount, and expected credits) is shown via MetaMask and Thrum before you authorize a blockchain transaction. Make sure that you review this carefully and note transaction time, FMV, and other relevant information.

6. Non-transferability and prohibited transfers

6.1. Thrum Credits are non-transferable and may not be sold, gifted, assigned, traded, or transferred to any other person or wallet.
6.2. Any attempted circumvention of (6.1), including a transfer or resale, is void and will result in an immediate suspension, termination, and sanction imposed on your address.

7. Refunds

7.1. Except where required by law, all purchases are final once the blockchain transaction is broadcast.
7.2. If you believe you were credited incorrectly or experienced an error, contact support at: vlad@usatii.com. We may investigate and, at our discretion, correct credit balances for confirmed system errors.
7.3. If we reasonably suspect that any deposit, transaction, purchase, or use of Thrum Credits involves fraud, abuse, misrepresentation, or other unlawful activity (including but not limited to false claims of deposit, identity fraud, attempts to resell, or any other prohibited conduct), we reserve the right to: freeze or suspend the relevant account and/or Credits; withhold or reverse any credit or purchase, even if initially approved; terminate your account and bar future access to Thrum services; report the suspected activity to appropriate governmental agencies and/or law-enforcement authorities; pursue all available legal remedies to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law.

8. Fees, expiration, and inactivity

8.1. We do not charge dormancy, inactivity, or maintenance fees on Thrum Credits unless disclosed in advance and permitted by applicable law.
8.2. Thrum Credits do not expire unless disclosed in advance and permitted by applicable law.
8.3. If we ever introduce expiration or fees, we will disclose the applicable terms conspicuously before purchase and in your account. Any user who had previously made an Ethereum transaction for credits before the instantiation of expiration will be excluded from the change.

9. Taxes

9.1. You are responsible for any taxes that may apply to your purchase or use of Thrum services, except where we are required to collect taxes.

10. Changes to these terms

10.1. We may update these Credit Terms from time to time. Changes apply prospectively from the “Last Updated” date.
