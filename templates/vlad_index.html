            i am a 3rd-year computer science student at rochester institute of technology, interested in competition math, program analysis and machine learning. rn, doing research on ethereum solidity and building state-of-the-art detectors for complex bug classes to help crypto protocols save millions of $$$; publishing to ACM soon. also building thrum as the world's first autonomous auditor, capable of catching practically every known class of solidity bugs, some at the cross-transaction, cross-contract, and even cross-protocol level, and then shipping you mitigations straight to your terminal. also building a Solidity library of secure functions to avoid needing any of thrum's products (putting my own business out of business lol). on the side, i run a marketing agency that has amassed the attention of elon musk, a16z, gamma ai, and several other big names and organizations. previously was tech lead for @onlocklearning. my agency regularly hits over 100 million views per month cumulatively among all clients. for fun, i play competition chess, piano, bet on prediction markets using sota quantitative models, and participate in crypto bug bounties.
